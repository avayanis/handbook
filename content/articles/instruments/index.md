OpsMezzo instruments is built on-top of [Godot][godot] _adding reactor primitives for orchestrating cloud applications:_

OpsMezzo instruments adds reactors for handling common operations and monitoring tasks such as:

* **Network monitoring:** Concerned about network or HTTP latency? We've got you covered.
* **Server and application provisioning:** Wouldn't you like to just scale your app instead of _telling your ops team to scale your app?_
* **SSH:** Run arbitrary processes on demand to respond to incidents.
* **Process monitoring:** Notify your team through alerting tools when crashes occur.

Lets consider how the above example, _emailing your ops team on high CPU load_, could be handled with Instruments:

Automating these common tasks frees up your developers and operations engineers to handle higher-level more important problems like **building your application and your business.**
